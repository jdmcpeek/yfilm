Yale's film culture has notoriously been weak and divided, not because of a lack of talent or interest, but because there exists no infrastructure equal to that of the university's theater community. The Yale Film Association (YFA) is a new student group that needs a way to foster the campus's moviemaking talent: to build crews with complementary skills, mentor the next generation of filmmakers, and connect students interested in the moviemaking culture. The YFilm site is a medium with which to do that. Visit the site at: yalefilm.herokuapp.com

##Functionality

The YFilm site is designed to bring artists together. For that reason, it is project-centric, allowing users to join crews and automatically add experiences to their filmography.

1. The *Screenings* page will take any visitor to a listing of all the most recent shows, where they can find more information on each film's page and sign up to attend.
- users can also view embedded trailers through the site. Projects owners need only attach a URL when creating a project.

2. Siging up is restricted to Yale students through the CAS authentication system

3. Users can:
- create projects
- signup for and create audition slots
- join projects in any role
